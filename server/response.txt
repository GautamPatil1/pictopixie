 1. **Describe the process of styling the background and text of an HTML element using CSS. Provide an example of how to set a background color and change the text color of a paragraph element.**

To style the background and text of an HTML element using CSS, you can use the following steps:

1. Select the HTML element you want to style.
2. Use the CSS `background` property to set the background color of the element.
3. Use the CSS `color` property to set the text color of the element.

For example, the following CSS code will set the background color of the `<p>` element to blue and the text color to white:

```
p {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}
```

2. **Explain the role of CSS selectors in applying styles. What is JavaScript, and what are its main advantages in web development? Provide at least 5 key features or applications of JavaScript.**

CSS selectors are used to select the HTML elements that you want to style. They are used in conjunction with CSS properties to apply styles to those elements.

There are many different CSS selectors, each of which selects a different set of elements. For example, the `p` selector selects all `<p>` elements, while the `.class` selector selects all elements with the class `class`.

JavaScript is a programming language that is used to make web pages interactive. It is a client-side language, which means that it is executed on the user's computer. JavaScript can be used to add features to web pages such as:

* Interactivity: JavaScript can be used to make web pages interactive by allowing users to interact with them. For example, JavaScript can be used to create forms that users can fill out, or to create games that users can play.
* Dynamic content: JavaScript can be used to create dynamic content that changes based on user input. For example, JavaScript can be used to create a news feed that updates automatically, or to create a shopping cart that updates as users add items to it.
* Animation: JavaScript can be used to create animations on web pages. For example, JavaScript can be used to create slideshows, or to create games that have animated characters.
* Data manipulation: JavaScript can be used to manipulate data on web pages. For example, JavaScript can be used to sort data, or to filter data.

3. **Explain the purpose and usage of JavaScript popup boxes. Provide an example of each type of popup box and describe when you might use them in a web application.**

JavaScript popup boxes are used to display information to users in a separate window. They can be used to display messages, alerts, or forms. There are three main types of JavaScript popup boxes:

* Alert boxes: Alert boxes are used to display a message to the user. They typically have an OK button that the user can click to close the box.
* Confirm boxes: Confirm boxes are used to ask the user a question. They typically have two buttons: OK and Cancel. The user can click either button to close the box.
* Prompt boxes: Prompt boxes are used to ask the user for input. They typically have a text field where the user can enter input. They also have two buttons: OK and Cancel. The user can click either button to close the box.

JavaScript popup boxes can be used in a variety of ways in web applications. For example, they can be used to:

* Display error messages to users.
* Ask users for confirmation before they perform an action.
* Collect input from users.

4. **Describe the CSS Box Model and its components. Explain how padding, margin, and border affect the layout of an HTML element. Additionally, provide an example of an advanced CSS technique or property used to create a responsive web design layout.**

The CSS Box Model is a way of understanding how HTML elements are laid out on a web page. It divides an element into four parts:

* The content box: This is the area where the element's content is displayed.
* The padding box: This is the area around the content box. It is used to add space between the content and the border.
* The border box: This is the area around the padding box. It is used to add a border to the element.
* The margin box: This is the area around the border box. It is used to add space between the element and other elements on the page.

The padding, margin, and border properties can be used to affect the layout of an HTML element. For example, the padding property can be used to add space between the element's content and the border. The margin property can be used to add space between the element and other elements on the page. The border property can be used to add a border to the element.

An example of an advanced CSS technique that can be used to create a responsive web design layout is media queries.
 13. **Design a Search bar using CSS and HTML.**

  margin-bottom: 10px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 3px;
}

button {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  padding: 10px 12px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 3px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #ccc;
}
```

14. **What are the input types for form validation in HTML? Explain with an example how to style the input fields.**

The input types for form validation in HTML are:

* `text` - This input type is used for single-line text input.
* `password` - This input type is used for password input. The text is masked as it is typed.
* `checkbox` - This input type is used to create a checkbox.
* `radio` - This input type is used to create a radio button.
* `submit` - This input type is used to submit a form.
* `reset` - This input type is used to reset a form to its initial state.

To style the input fields, you can use the following CSS properties:

* `width` - This property specifies the width of the input field.
* `height` - This property specifies the height of the input field.
* `margin` - This property specifies the margin around the input field.
* `padding` - This property specifies the padding around the input field.
* `border` - This property specifies the border of the input field.
* `background-color` - This property specifies the background color of the input field.
* `color` - This property specifies the color of the text in the input field.

For example, the following CSS code will style the input fields in a form:

```
input[type="text"] {
  width: 200px;
  height: 25px;
  margin: 5px;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #000;
}
```

 1. The perimeter of a rectangle is 40 cm. If the length is 10 cm, find the area of the rectangle.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width. We are given that P = 40 cm and l = 10 cm. We can substitute these values into the formula to find w:

40 = 2(10 + w)

20 = 10 + w

w = 10

Now that we know the length and width of the rectangle, we can find the area using the formula A = lw:

A = 10 * 10

A = 100

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 100 cm^2.

2. A shopkeeper buys 100 pens at a cost of $100. He sells 80 pens at a profit of 20%. Find the selling price of each pen.

The cost of each pen is $100 / 100 = $1. The profit on each pen is $1 * 20% = $0.20. The selling price of each pen is $1 + $0.20 = $1.20.

3. A train travels 200 km in 2 hours. Find the average speed of the train in km/h.

The average speed of a train is given by the formula v = d / t, where v is the speed, d is the distance, and t is the time. We are given that d = 200 km and t = 2 hours. We can substitute these values into the formula to find v:

v = 200 / 2

v = 100

Therefore, the average speed of the train is 100 km/h.

4. A man invests $10,000 in a bank account that pays 5% interest per year. How much money will he have in the account after 5 years if the interest is compounded annually?

The amount of money in the account after 5 years can be calculated using the formula A = P(1 + r)^t, where A is the amount of money in the account, P is the principal (the initial amount invested), r is the annual interest rate, and t is the number of years. In this case, we have P = $10,000, r = 5%, and t = 5. We can substitute these values into the formula to find A:

A = 10000(1 + 0.05)^5

A = 10000(1.05)^5

A = 12762.82

Therefore, the man will have $12,762.82 in the account after 5 years.

5. A farmer has 100 chickens. He sells 20% of the chickens. How many chickens does he have left?

The farmer has 100 chickens. He sells 20% of the chickens, which is 100 * 20% = 20 chickens. Therefore, the farmer has 100 - 20 = 80 chickens left.

 1. **Describe the process of styling the background and text of an HTML element using CSS. Provide an example of how to set a background color and change the text color of a paragraph element.**

For example, the following CSS selector selects all of the paragraph elements on a page:

```
p {
  /* CSS properties */
}
```

The following CSS selector selects all of the paragraph elements that have a class of "my-class":

```
p.my-class {
  /* CSS properties */
}
```
